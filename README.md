### User control

Change the master output volume, sample rate, clock source, system default input and output and more!

### Always in the status bar!

AudioMate can display up to 2 parameters in the status bar at once:

* the device's master volume (graphical, percentage, or dB)
* the device's sample rate
* the device's clock source

### Device actions

Decide what actions to run when a device is connected, such as setting the device's master volume, sample rate, or clock source.

### System notifications

Receive system notifications about relevant events happening on your audio devices, such as when...

* a device is added or removed
* a device's volume changes
* a device's mute state changes
* a device's sample rate changes
* a device's clock source changes

Note: This functionality requires Growl when using Mac OS X 10.7. For later versions, Mac OS X's Notification Center (already integrated into Mac OS X 10.8 and later) will be used instead.
